## Installation

Just download the directory or make a copy of it. Once you've downloaded or copied the directory, you can start looking through its files and making any changes you need. It is best to keep the directory up-to-date so that you always have the most recent version of the files.

## Usage

As a coding boot camp student, I want a JavaScript fundamentals timed quiz with high marks to compare my progress to my peers.
Given my code test, I'm asked a question and a timer starts when I press start. After answering a question, I get another. Time is deducted when I answer a question incorrectly. I can save my initials and score when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
